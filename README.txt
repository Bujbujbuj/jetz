Hey team!

Quick note: between trainings and work I don't expect this project to have a hard start/end. More a collaborative effort over time.
  Also I am locked out of NIPR bc someone decided to involve me in an NDCI. Yay.

The following README is to provide some structure for how JETZ could be written, and how we can collaborate via distance on the project.

OBJECT: Write a text-based adventure game aimed at developing basic skills on C++ with a complex file structure.
